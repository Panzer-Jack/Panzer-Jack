I am a student majoring in Computer Network from Shanghai, and I enjoy creating things that interest me and sharing them here.

I mainly study in the field of web dev.

I am a pragmatistic dreamer. I had many dreams: such as opening a hobby studio to do something interesting, becoming an indie game producer or finding a group of Like-minded Lab members do some interesting gizmos. But for now, I'm going to put that aside for a moment and look for the reality. 

In the near future, as long as possible, I will still look for my own ideal life style.
